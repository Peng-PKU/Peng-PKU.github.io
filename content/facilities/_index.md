        <span style="font-size: 0.85em;">JEM-ARM300F2 transmission electron microscope offers state-of-the-art sub-angstrom imaging and analysis for both light and heavy elements. Operating at 40–300 kV, it features a cold field emission gun with enhanced coherence, brightness, and stability. Compatible techniques include HRTEM, EFTEM, STEM HAADF/BF/OBF, EDS/EELS mapping, and 4D-STEM. An electrostatic dose controller enables atomic-scale analysis of beam-sensitive materials. In situ holders allow real-time characterization under cryogenic, high-temperature, and electric field conditions.</span>
