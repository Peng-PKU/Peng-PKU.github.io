        <span style="font-size: 0.85em;">JEM-F200 field emission transmission electron microscope is a versatile instrument for nanoscale structural and physical property analysis in materials science. It operates at an accelerating voltage of 200/80 kV and is equipped with a cold field emission gun, offering excellent coherence, brightness, and stability. The system supports HRTEM, STEM HAADF/BF imaging, and EDS mapping. Combined with in situ cryogenic electrical holders and in situ thermal-electrical holders, it enables real-time characterization of material structures at the nanoscale under external fields such as low/high temperatures and applied voltages.</span>
