        We are the <em>Topological Magnetism & L-TEM Lab</em>,  
        a research division under the leadership of   
        <a href="https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/houyanglong/zh_CN/xsxx/50668/list/index.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Yanglong Hou</a> at Peking University.  
        We focus on emergent spin textures and topological phenomena in magnetic systems. Below is an introduction to our core members.
